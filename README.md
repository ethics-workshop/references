## Ethics-review committees

- Academia conferences
	- Major security conferences typically have an ethics review
		committee; contact the PC chairs if you need help
- Universities
	- Institutional Review Boards (US) and Ethics Review Committees
		(Europe)
	- Note: IRB and ERC are NOT sufficient for ethics in cybersecurity
